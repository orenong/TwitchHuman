## What is TwitchHuman

TwitchHuman is an interactive and configurable AI twitch chat bot.
TwitchHuman can interact with the stream, and the chatters on twitch's chat, in a human-like way. 
TwitchHuman Includes many ways to mask being a bot, using typos (and correcting them), intentional mistakes, multi-line messages, emulated feelings, long context, adaptive behavior based on the "vibe" of the chat and simply imidiatly denying being a bot whenever its mentioned. 

## Features (W.I.P)
All of the following features will be included in the v1 release

<b>Listen and see the stream</b> -  The bot can see what the streamer does, ignore user defined zones (such as chat, or confusing UI elements) and react not just to the chat, but also to the video and the audio.

<b>drunkenness levels</b> -  A settings for how crazy the bot responses are, how often it makes nistakes or typos, how quickly it can get very angry, happy and more (based on the chat's vibe). The level does not have an upper limit, it can be increased as much the user wishes, to allow a lot of fun.

<b>multi-line messages</b> - Unlike traditional twitch chat bots, TwitchHuman can split its messages to multiple messages sent one after the other. This is used to emulate correction of typos, mistakes, or just long messages when it seems appropriate. This is one of the key features making TwitchHuman seem believable

<b>WPM</b> - Words Per Minute - Calculating the (minimum) time it should take the bot to respond, based on the number of words it had to read and write.

<b>Local and cloud models support</b> Supporting any Multimodal language model that can take multiple images as an input through LM-studio, Ollama, openAI or gemini's API with easily modifiable code to add more providers.

<b>Live gui</b> a gui to monitor the bot's status, interactions, edit what parts of the stream it can see, manually alter its behavior in real time and see + cancel messages before they are sent in chat
